Temporal provides features that significantly reduce latency, making your applications faster, more performant, and more efficient.
In the world of modern applications, low latency is crucial for ensuring minimal delay in Workflow Executions.

Temporal Cloud includes architectural advancements like a custom persistence layer, which reduce latency effectively.
Benchmarks have shown that application-side latency is lower when using Temporal Cloud. For example, Temporal Cloud completes workflows nearly twice as fast as self-hosted instances.

Temporal Cloud’s architecture includes a custom persistence layer with three key components:

- **Better Sharding:** Dynamic sharding of persistent state across multiple databases allows for independent resizing, improving scalability and handling high-traffic events.
- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL):** This log stores writes in an append-only format, reducing latency and database size by batching updates before writing to the database.
- **Tiered Storage of Workflow Event History:** Moving completed Workflow Event Histories to an object store reduces database load, improving efficiency and latency for running Workflows.

Temporal Cloud provides lower latency, making it suitable for latency-sensitive, large-scale, or business-critical applications.
Temporal Cloud also offers a lower price per performance compared to self-hosted Temporal due to its architectural efficiencies and consumption-based costs.
